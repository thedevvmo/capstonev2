#Creating context 

to create context we need to have a default value - 
which will be exported and altered later on....

e.g. export const ProductContext = createContext({
    #data we want to export
})

#Creating provider function 

- function that contains a useState function which is the value that will be given to the context

- the Provider gives access to the context to its children
    e.g. <ProductContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</ProductContext.Provider>
